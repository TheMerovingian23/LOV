# LottoVisionOrder

## Overview
LottoVisionOrder is an innovative AI-powered system that uses computer vision to automate the ordering of lottery ticket numbers based on customer selections. This tool is designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of lottery ticket processing at retail locations.

## Features
- **Image Recognition:** Utilizes computer vision to accurately interpret numbers from customer-filled play slips.
- **Order Sequencing:** Automatically reorders the recognized numbers according to customizable rules.
- **Integration Support:** Easily integrates with existing lottery systems and ticket printers.
- **User Interface:** Provides a simple interface for customers and staff to verify and edit ticket selections before printing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV for Python
- NumPy
- Flask (for web interface)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LottoVisionOrder.git
cd LottoVisionOrder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
To start the application, run:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage
Once the application is running, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` on your web browser to access the user interface where you can upload lottery play slips and view the ordered results.

## Code Example
Here's a simple example of how the image processing might be handled:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def process_ticket_image(image_path):
    # Load the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Apply thresholding to get the binary image
    _, binary = cv2.threshold(gray, 225, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)

    # Find contours
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(binary, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    # Example: process contours to find numbers (mock-up)
    numbers = []
    for cnt in contours:
        # Assume each contour is a number for simplicity
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(cnt)
        numbers.append((x, y, w, h))

    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort by x coordinate
    return numbers

# Example usage
numbers = process_ticket_image('path_to_ticket_image.jpg')
print("Detected numbers:", numbers)
```
